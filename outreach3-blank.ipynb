    "A python excersie notebook written by Lewis McMillan, Summer 2020. This notebook has benifited from examples provided by Rita Tojeiro, and the help of Anne-Marie Weijmans, and Simon Reynolds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), to explore how astronomers interact with \"big data\", and how they can use various different measurments of galaxies shapes in order to find spiral galaxies, the mergering of multiple galaxies, and other interesting galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SDSS and SciServer\n",
    "As mentioned above, in this notebook we will use data from SDSS, which is is the largest astronmical dataset in the world currently. For eachs nights observing it generates around 200Gb of data. The laptop this notebook was written on has 256Gb of storage space, meaning that I could fit 1 nights observing data on my laptop with some space left over for all the programs I need to analysie the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are reading this then we assume that you havel alredy followed the instructions to get an account on SciServer, and have uploaded this notebook. In addition to this we assume that you are familiar with basic python, dataframe manipulation, and matplotlib commands. If not please complete Rita Tojeiro's notebook's which cover these topics: link here"
